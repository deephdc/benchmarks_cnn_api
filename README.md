DEEP Open Catalogue: API for Tensorflow Benchmarks
==============================

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/buildStatus/icon?job=Pipeline-as-code/DEEP-OC-org/benchmarks_cnn_api/master)](https://jenkins.indigo-datacloud.eu/job/Pipeline-as-code/job/DEEP-OC-org/job/benchmarks_cnn_api/job/master)

[tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) from TensorFlow team accessed via [DEEPaaS API V2](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS).

This is a **wrapper** to access the [TF Benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks), **not the benchmarks code** itself! 
One has to install [tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks)
and [TensorFlow Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models) and make them accessible in Python. For example for TF 1.10.0, as

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 -b cnn_tf_v1.10_compatible https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks.git
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$PWD/benchmarks/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks
```

The **recommended way** to run [TF Benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) through [DEEPaaS API](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS)
is to use our [Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/deephdc/deep-oc-benchmarks_cnn) also available through the [DEEP Open Catalog](https://marketplace.deep-hybrid-datacloud.eu/modules/deep-oc-benchmarks-cnn.html).
The Docker images already **contain** [TF Benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks) and [DEEPaaS API](https://github.com/indigo-dc/DEEPaaS).

## From [tf_cnn_benchmarks](https://github.com/tensorflow/benchmarks/tree/master/scripts/tf_cnn_benchmarks):
tf_cnn_benchmarks contains implementations of several popular convolutional
models, and is designed to be as fast as possible. tf_cnn_benchmarks supports
both running on a single machine or running in distributed mode across multiple
hosts. See the [High-Performance models
guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_models) for more
information.

These models utilize many of the strategies in the [TensorFlow Performance
Guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/performance_guide). Benchmark
results can be found [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/docs/blob/master/site/en/r1/guide/performance/benchmarks.md).

These models are designed for performance. For models that have clean and
easy-to-read implementations, see the [TensorFlow Official
Models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official).
